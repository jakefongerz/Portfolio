# Weather App
Welcome to this simple weather app!

This app was originally made for a web dev class I took at USU. I am currently working on adding more attributes to it.
At the moment, the app uses **[Abstract API](https://www.abstractapi.com/)** to estimate your location based on your location. 
**[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)** is to receive the weather information. 

These app provides you with the weather in your area with a 5 day forcast. The forcast is incremented by 3 hour periods.
Click on the different increments to vote on weather or not you think it is accurate. 

## Running the App
After downloading the **WeatherApp** directory simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
